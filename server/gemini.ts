    ${topicName === "Your Class" ? 
      `SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR "Your Class" TOPIC:
      - Focus SPECIFICALLY on interesting and funny classroom relationships and dynamics
      - Include prompts about:
        * Humorous teacher-student interactions and misunderstandings
        * Funny classroom incidents and memorable moments
        * Interesting or unusual classmate personalities and relationships
        * Amusing group dynamics during class activities
        * Entertaining classroom traditions or inside jokes
      - Make prompts lighthearted, humorous and engaging
      - Focus on RELATIONSHIPS between people, not just academic topics` 
      : ""
    }

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Each prompt (Ask, Tell, Reveal) MUST be EXTREMELY DIFFERENT from each other in these ways:
    - Focus on completely different aspects of the "${topicName}" topic - avoid any thematic overlap
    - Use entirely different vocabulary domains and hint words
    - Address different time periods (past/present/future) when appropriate
    - Cover different emotional contexts (positive/neutral/challenging)
    - Target different cognitive skills (remembering/analyzing/describing/imagining/evaluating)

    IMPORTANT CEFR REQUIREMENTS:
    - Keep all prompts VERY SHORT and SIMPLE (maximum 20 words)
    - Make vocabulary strictly appropriate for ${level} CEFR level
    - B1: Use simple, everyday vocabulary and common expressions
    - B2: Use some idiomatic expressions and more varied vocabulary 
    - C1: Use more sophisticated vocabulary and complex language structures
    - C2: Use nuanced vocabulary, abstract concepts and specialized terminology

    IMPORTANT: Make sure these prompts are RADICALLY DIFFERENT from any you've generated before. Use the random seed value ${randomSeed} to create maximally diverse variations.

    Please provide three prompts following this structure:
    1. "Ask" - IMPORTANT: This should be a prompt instructing the student to ask ANOTHER student a specific question. The question should begin with "Ask your partner about..." or similar phrasing.
    2. "Tell" - IMPORTANT: This should be a STATEMENT, not a question. It should begin with "Tell your partner about..." or similar phrasing.
    3. "Reveal" - A question that encourages the student to share something personal or unique.

    For each prompt, provide:
    - A clear instruction (following the guidelines above)
    - A VERY brief context to help guide the student's response (maximum 15 words)
    - 5 helpful hint words that students can use in their answers that MUST be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the other prompts and appropriate for the CEFR level

    Format your response as a valid JSON object with this structure:

      "stages": [
        {
          "stage": "Ask",
