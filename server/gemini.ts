    Create a COMPLETELY UNIQUE set of ESL speaking practice prompts for the "Ask, Tell, Reveal" activity format at CEFR level ${level} about the topic "${topicName}". Random seed: ${randomSeed}

    IMPORTANT: Make sure these prompts are DIFFERENT from any you've generated before. Use the random seed value ${randomSeed} to create unique variations.

    Please provide three prompts following this structure:
    1. "Ask" - IMPORTANT: This should be a prompt instructing the student to ask ANOTHER student a specific question. The question should begin with "Ask your partner about..." or similar phrasing.
    2. "Tell" - A deeper follow-up question that requires more detailed responses.
    3. "Reveal" - A question that encourages the student to share something personal or unique.

    For each prompt, provide:
    - A clear question (remember "Ask" must instruct the student to ask ANOTHER student something)
    - A brief context to help guide the student's response
    - 5 helpful hint words that students can use in their answers that are DIFFERENT from previous prompts

    Format your response as a valid JSON object with this structure:
