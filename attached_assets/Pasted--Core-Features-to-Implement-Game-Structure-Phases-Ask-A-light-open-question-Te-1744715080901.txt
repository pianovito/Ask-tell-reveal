 Core Features to Implement
🧩 Game Structure
* Phases:
    * Ask – A light, open question.
    * Tell – A deeper follow-up.
    * Reveal – Prompts personal, previously unshared reflections.
🎨 UI & Brand
* Modern, playful interface using these colors:
    * Primary: #3498db (Vibrant Blue)
    * Secondary: #f39c12 (Soft Orange)
    * Accents: #2ecc71, #9b59b6
    * Text: #34495e
    * Background: #ecf0f1 → gradient to light green.

📘 Pedagogical Features
* CEFR Level Selector (B1, B2, C1) – Adjusts question complexity.
* Grammar Focus Mode – E.g., respond using second conditional.
* Vocabulary Challenge – Include a target word in the response.
* Reflection Prompt – Appears after Reveal for self-awareness.

🧠 Content & Data
* Fetch prompts and hint words from Google Gemini Flash 2 API based on CEFR and topic.
* Topics (user selects): Childhood, Friendship, Travel, Dreams, Family, Embarrassment, etc.
* Provide 3–4 hint words dynamically after question generation.

🎮 Gamification (Group-Only)
* Group XP System – Earn XP by completing rounds or using grammar targets.
* Achievements – Class earns badges (e.g., “Everyone revealed once”).
* Spin the Topic Wheel – Optional random topic chooser.
* Pass-the-Question – Peer selects next speaker.
* No single-user mode – Designed for teacher-led classrooms.

* Use app icon animation while loading AI generated contents.
* Add icons to the left of each text field using Tailwind CSS and an icon library (e.g., Heroicons or FontAwesome).
* The icons should visually match the purpose of the text field:
* Pen icon for text box to type in and generate content through AI
* Bar chart for “CEFR Level”
* Flask or beaker for “Story Theme”
* Each icon should appear inside the input box or dropdown selector, aligned to the left, without breaking the layout.
